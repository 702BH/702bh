## Hi there 👋
I’m a data engineer who enjoys tackling challenging problems and learning through building.

I enjoy learning by implementing things myself — especially problems that
involve algorithms, stateful systems, performance constraints, and clear
data models. I’m most motivated when the work requires reasoning, trade-offs,
and ownership.

## About Me
- Data engineer with a systems-oriented mindset  
- Comfortable working close to core logic, algorithms, and data structures  
- Prefer understanding *why* systems work, not just *how* to use tools  

## Recent Personal Projects
### 🧠 Raven — Goal-Based AI & Systems Architecture
A from-scratch implementation of multiple interacting subsystems inspired by
*Programming Game AI by Example*, created with GDScript (Python like programming language) and the Godot engine.

**Key areas of work:**
- Custom navigation graph and pathfinding (Dijkstra / A*)
- Custom collision system with spatial partitioning
- Custom map editor with JSON serialization and precomputed navigation costs
- Goal-based AI agents with perception, state memory, and arbitration

The goal of this project was to design a transparent, deterministic decision system where agent behavior could be reasoned about, debugged, and extended.

### 🌍 Marching Squares Procedural Terrain destruction
A procedural terrain system built in GDScript using the Godot engine, focused on real-time topology updates and destruction. 

**Key areas of work:**
- Marching squares algorithm implementation
- optimised chunking system for large scale worlds
- player interaction for terrain destruction
- custom ore generation to spawn ore deposits in the terrain

The goal of this project was to challenge myself to implement an algorithm from scratch using resources and then extend with my own functionality.
