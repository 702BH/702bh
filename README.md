## Hi there 👋
I’m a data engineer who enjoys challenges themselves and constantly learning.

I enjoy learning by implementing things myself — especially problems that
involve algorithms, stateful systems, performance constraints, and clear
data models. I’m most motivated when the work requires reasoning, trade-offs,
and ownership.

## About Me
- Data engineer with a systems-oriented mindset  
- Comfortable working close to core logic, algorithms, and data structures  
- Prefer understanding *why* systems work, not just *how* to use tools  

## Recent Personal Projects
### 🧠 Raven — Goal-Based AI & Systems Architecture
A from-scratch implementation of multiple interacting subsystems inspired by
*Programming Game AI by Example*, created with GDScript (Python like programming language) and the Godot engine.

**Key areas of work:**
- Custom navigation graph and pathfinding (Dijkstra / A*)
- Custom collision system with spatial partitioning
- Custom map editor with JSON serialization and precomputed navigation costs
- Goal-based AI agents with perception, state memory, and arbitration

The goal of this project was to build "AI" agents capable of perceiving the environment and making decisions.
